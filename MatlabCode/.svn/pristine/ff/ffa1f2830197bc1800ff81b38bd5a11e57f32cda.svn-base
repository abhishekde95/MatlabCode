function out = GetVal(codes, events, type)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% function out = GetVal(codes, events, <type>)
%
% Generic function for pulling the value of the ecode 
% that follows another specified ecode.
%
% First input argument should be one or more 8000-level codes.
% 1) If a single code is given, we find that code in the event stream, take
%   the code following it, and return it after having subtracted VALOFFSET.
% 2) If a vector of codes are given, we do this same thing for each element
%   of the vector.
% 3) If a two element vector is given and the two elements are the same, 
%   the codes are treated as bookends.  Two instances of the code are
%   found and the values between them are extracted and returned.
%
% the optional argument, Type, can be "long", "float", or "double".

% Takes a NxMx3 matrix and converts it into an Nx2Mx3 matrix that this
% appropriate for driving the Bits++ box in "colour mode".  In colour mode,
% the Bits++ takes pairs of pixels and combines them into one pixel with 14
% bits of intensity resolution on each gun.
%
% The format of the image passed to the Bits++ bix should be pairs of
% bytes, a high order byte and a low order byte (the lowest two bits of
% which are presumably ignored since the Bits++ does 14 bit D/A
% conversion).
%
% If any of the values in the input argument exceeds 255, we assume that the
% user is passing an image where 0 means minimum intensity and 65535 means
% maximum intensity.  This interpretation can also be forced by setting
% <opt> to 1.  Alternatively, we interpret the image as 0 means minimum
% intensity and 255 means maximum intensity (and we just zero out the low
% bytes).

%
%   example: [sock, success] = pnetStart(port, [hostIP], [ShakeHands], [TimeOut])
%
% Initializes communication via UDP. Port: should be the local host port
% number. hostIP: should be represented as a STRING. If host IP is given
% then it is assumed that the udp socket should be "connected", otherwise
% it is assumed that the socket is "connectionless". If a hostIP is
% specified than the host machine must be using the same port as the local
% host. ShakeHands: if equal to 1 then the routine ensures that the host
% computer is able to send and recieve messages to/from the host computer.
% TimeOut is an optional argument and specifies how long (in Seconds) the
% funtion will attempt to initiate a UDP connection. If not specified, the
% funtion will try for 10sec. Outputs: Sock is the scalar socket
% identifier. Success returns 1 if the initialization was successful and 0
% otherwise.

% The Fourier transform is probably the most important transform in applied

% math. It takes a function, typically of time or space, and expresses it

% as a function of frequency. The goals of this tutorial are to make you

% comfortable with what a Fourier transform is, how to compute one, and why 

% it is useful. We will focus on two topics: (1) definition and properties of 

% the Fourier transform, (2) convolution, and (3) the connection between the two. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



% Part I. The discrete Fourier transform



% A transform is (usually) a reversible mapping from one set of values to

% another set of values. The Fourier transform takes a list of intensities 

% at points in time (or space) and transform them to a list of "intensities" 

% at different frequencies.

% Thinking about a signal as a collection of time intensities, each

% associated with its own time point, is simple enough. Thinking about a

% signal as a list of intensities, each associated with its own sinusoidal

% frequency, is also convenient. Perhaps because of the way our auditory system 

% is organized, we find thinking in frequency quite natural and intuitive.

% You do it every day when you adjust the

% bass and treble on your stereo -- or better yet, if you adjust knobs on

% an equalizer. You can imagine that describing a signal in terms of its

% frequencies can be convenient in certain settings. That's what the

% Fourier transform is for. 

% 

% We should emphasize from the start that taking a Fourier transform (FT, for

% short) does not change the signal; it just represents it differently. To

% be concrete, suppose there is some electrical signal that we want to

% describe over the phone to a friend. We could list the voltages at each

% time or we could list the amplitudes and phases of each of the

% frequencies that comprise the signal. It's the same signal, just a

% different list of numbers. Sometimes it is much faster and simpler to use

% one type of description than the other.

% 

% Often, when we describe signals, we don't think of them as lists of

% numbers but rather as functions of time. Of course, the function can be

% viewed as a way to generate a list of values at each time point. We

% can also use a function to describe the list of "intensities" at each

% frequency in a Fourier transform. The two functions are called Fourier

% transform pairs. For example, suppose s(t)  is some function of time (it

% has a value at each time point). And suppose that you could describe

% the same signal by "intensities" of frequency (w) using a function, S(w).

% Then, we say that s(t) and S(w) are a Fourier transform pair. Or we say

% that S(w) is the Fourier transform of s(t), or that s(t) is the inverse

% Fourier transform of S(w).  When we started by saying that a transform is

% a reversible mapping, what this means is that S(w) is the unique Fourier

% transform of s(t) and s(t) is the unique inverse transform of S(w).



% Our goal here is both to help you to get comfortable with the meaning of

% the Fourier transform, and to get you used to using the numerical

% function FFT (fast Fourier transform) in Matlab. If you get everything

% about what that matlab function returns to you, you'll pretty much have 

% mastered what you need to know.



% Before we look at FTs, let's get comfortable with a few illustrative

% functions. Since we'll be doing everything numerically in this tutorial,

% we will focus here on discrete functions. What is meant by this is

% that we are going to make the argument of the function, say time, take 

% discrete values. We're used to thinking of time t occupying some continuous 

% interval on the real number line, but here we'll be thinking of time as 

% integers, multiplied by some constant or scaling factor. In fact this is 

% overwhelmingly going to be the case whenever you are thinking about real 

% data: the values are always sampled at some particular finite sampling rate. 

%%

clear all



% Define a discrete time axis. The spacing is dt

dt = .01;      % our units are seconds. So each integer time point is scaled to represent dt sec

tmax = 1

t = [0:dt:tmax-dt]';

% Notice that we are sampling time at a rate of 1/dt. This will be

% important later.

samplingRate = 1/dt    % in Hz


%%

% Think of a discrete function as a series of weights at each of the points

% in t.  Let's look at some functions this way. Here's a gaussian profile

% centered at .5

f1 = exp(-.5*(t-.5).^2 / (.05)^2);

figure(1),clf,hold on

h = plot(t,f1)

xlabel('Time [s]')

ylabel('Amplitude')


%%
% Pause here. The function is drawn continously: there are no gaps. That's

% because matlab drew a line, or interpolated, between the values at the discrete time

% points. In reality, what we know about the function is just a bunch of heights at each of

% the time points. We can use the stem function to highlight this fact.


stem(t,f1,'filled');



%% 

%and we can toggle the smooth curve off

set(h,'Visible','off')


%%

% Now... that's a discrete function. Each of the points can be thought of as

% a weight given to the basis set of discrete time points. We represent the

% function as a list of these weights. Indeed, f1 is a vector.

size(f1)


% Let's remember this function by calling it something mnemonic

gaus1 = f1;

% Let's look at a few more functions

f2 = zeros(size(t));

f2(t>=.45 & t<= .54) = 1;

% comb(.1t) function. This is a sampling function or strobe function that

% turns on at a rate of 10 times per second (10 Hz). But it is also a sum

% of discrete delta functions.

comb10 = f7;

stem(t,comb10,'filled')


%%

% Reflection point. You have yet to see a Fourier transform. You are

% supposed to simply marvel at the idea of discreteness. And here is the

% one thing extra that you need to think about. All of the functions above

% can be thought of as sums of discrete delta functions with appropriately chosen

% weights. The most obvious example is the comb function, as we have

% already noted. But all the functions are just values at discrete time

% points. So all can be thought of as sums of delta functions. In fact, a discrete

% function is exactly this: the multiplication of a continuous function by

% comb(d*t), where d is the gap between samples (i.e., the reciprocal of the

% sampling rate). We will return to this point later.

%

% Another important point to make before moving on. Let's recall the idea of a

% BASIS SET from linear algebra.  As you know, a coordinate frame is a set of 

% vectors which span a given space: e.g. in the plane, we have an x axis, and 

% a y axis. So to say that a point in the plane is (3,2) means that our vector 

% contains 3 units along the x axis, and 2 units along the y axis. 

% A functional basis set is just a coordinate set for the space of

% functions. What does this mean?  Let's take some arbitrary data sequence, a bunch of

% values from time zero to time T. Since it is discretized, we have N points 

% in our data: a value for at each time, 0, dt, 2dt, 3dt,.. (N-1)dt.

% Let's now think about this data as an N-dimensional vector, and plot it

% as a single point in an N-dimensional space.  What is the coordinate

% system in which we have plotted our function? The unit vectors are the set 

% of delta functions at each time, t = i dt, for i ranging from 0 to N-1. So axis one

% means how strong was the function at time t = 0, axis 2 is how strong

% the function was at time t = dt, and so on.  If we write these as vectors

% they will look just like Euclidean coordinate axes: [1 0 0 0 0 0 ..], [0 1 0 0

% 0 ...], etc. 

% Remember that an important property of many useful coordinate systems is

% that the axes are orthogonal: the x vector has exactly zero projection onto 

% the y vector; the dot product of the x vector with the y vector is zero.

% Similarly for our delta function coordinate system. The

% delta function at time t is independent of the delta function at time t'

% if t is not the same as t'; the dot product of these two functions is zero.

% As we said already, any function can be written in this "time" basis by summing 

% up weighted delta functions.



% Now, let's move onto Fourier transforms. We had better start by defining 

% it.  As we've said, calling it a transform already gives away something 

% important. The function or data we're describing is not changed; it's just expressed 

% differently. Just like when you rotate something --you don't change the structure 

% of the thing you rotated. 

%

% So now, instead of thinking of the function as a list of weights at the

% discrete time samples, we would now like to think of it as a list of "weights" on

% sinusoids. In other words, since the time representation was just one 

% choice of coordinate systems, we can just as well represent our data function, 

% or N-dimensional point, in some other coordinate system. The Fourier transform 

% is a method for representing our data in another set of axes, where the axes are  

% sines and cosines rather than delta functions. 



% This is done in a way that will need a little unpacking. Let's look at the definition

% of the Fourier transform F(w) of a continuous function f(t):

%

% F(w) = (1/sqrt(2 pi)) integral dt f(t) exp( - i w t). 

%

% (check out the wikipedia entry to see this in proper math type!)



% The integral here is the equivalent for a continuous function of a dot product or 

% projection. So the idea is that we project our data function against the basis 

% function exp(-i w t), where w is frequency; one basis function for every value of w. 

% So how is this sines and cosines? Remember back to the olden days when you first met 

% complex numbers. Remember Euler's identity:

%

% exp( i x) = cos(x) + i sin(x). 

%

% Let's have a look at some examples:

%%

exp(i*0.5)

%%

exp(i*pi)

%%

exp(i*-pi)

%%

exp(i*pi/2)

%%

% All of these are complex numbers, but with different real and imaginary

% parts. (If the above didn't give you back a complex number, try 



clear i



% in case you have redefined "i" somehow as a real number.)



% I included some particular cases where the real or the imaginary

% part is zero. So what is this i thing? It's telling you

% that this is really a two-component number, with two "axes", the "real"

% axis and the "imaginary" axis, where the length of the number exp(i x) along the 

% real axis is cos(x), and its length along the imaginary axis is sin(x).

% We could write it in vector notation as (cos(x), sin(x)) and plot it as a

% point on a plane. The length of the vector is 1, since 

%

% cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1. 

%

% If we want a longer vector, we scale the whole thing by some amplitude

% A: A exp( i x). The value of x is the phase in radians.

%

% So: every complex number is really 2-dimensional, and every  exp(- i w t) 

% for a given w will give us two components, one real, corresponding to the

% cosine at frequency w, and one imaginary, corresponding to the sine.

% This is just an elegant way to capture the issue that for every frequency, we need two

% values. Why? Because every frequency component is specified both by an

% AMPLITUDE and a PHASE. Using both a sine and a cosine component allows us

% to construct any arbitrary phase. Remember another fact from your dim

% dark past: the sin identities. Do you remember:

%

% sin (x+y) = sin(x) cos(y) + sin(y) cos(x)?

%

% so let's say x is t and y is some phase p. 

% then a sin (t + p) = a * cos(p)*sin(t) + a * sin(p)*cos(t), where a*cos(p) 

% and a*sin(p) now become the coefficients of the sine and cosine functions. Again, 

% the total amplitude is a * sqrt(sin(p)**2 + cos(p)**2) = a!  So representing phase 

% as well as overall amplitude is why you need both a sine and a cosine at every 

% frequency. Using complex numbers for each frequency is just a way to do

% this neatly and elegantly.



% Let's see that in action. Let's look at the real and imaginary parts of the function 

% exp(i w t), for w = 2 pi.  (this frequency is angular frequency! here we

% will generally take out the 2 pi factor, w = 2 pi f, and work in hertz..)

% So what's the upshot: by projecting onto exp(i w t), we are actually 

% projecting against both a sine and a cosine function of frequency w.  

% Remember that a sine, or any other function, is just a linear sum of the 

% delta functions so this is just a linear transformation. 

% Even better, since sines and cosines of different frequencies are orthogonal, 

% the sines and cosines form an orthogonal basis set. The sines and cosines are not the only

% functions that we could choose for our alternative basis set, but they

% are useful so often that the Fourier transform is one of the most

% commonly used of all possibilities. When we study dimensionality

% reduction, we will talk about some other alternatives.



% Let's look at some examples.



% Let's start with a cosine function. What do you expect to see? Let's bung

% the cosine function into matlab's function fft and plot. I will use a

% frequency f of 10 Hz. Worth mentioning now that in the above we have used the 

% symbol w for omega, which is the angular frequency. Frequency in Hz is related to

% angular frequency by a factor of 2 pi, w = 2 pi f, which is often useful to factor

% out. 



y = cos(2*pi*10*t);

figure(2), clf

subplot(1,2,1)

plot(t,y)

xlabel('Time')

subplot(1,2,2)

fcos = fft(y);

plot(fcos); ylabel('Fourier transform of cosine function')

%%

% What the *$&#^%?  (pardon my Australian.)

% Let's see what you have plotted.



whos fcos

%%

% Ah ha. The fft of y is, of course, a complex array, so has a real and imaginary part.

% When you use plot, matlab plots the real part vs the imaginary part.

% So let's plot each of the two parts separately.



subplot(1,2,1); 

plot(real(fcos));

ylabel('Real part of fft(cos t)');

subplot(1,2,2); 

plot(imag(fcos));

ylabel('Imaginary part of ft(cos t)');

%%

% Now we're getting somewhere. The real part has two big spikes; the imaginary 

% part is tiny, really just zero except for numerical noise.

% Now, why and where are those two big spikes?

% We put in a 100-dimensional purely real data vector, and got out a

% 100-dimensional complex vector, meaning 200 values. That seems to be

% twice as many as we need. We'll talk more about this later. 

% We have obtained a function of frequency, but what are the labels on the 

% frequency axis? 



% Let's recall yet another high school fact: how do you

% write a cosine in terms of complex numbers? It's just a rewriting of the

% definition (known as the Euler identity) we used above. 



% Remember: 

%

%   cos(a) = [ exp(ia) + exp(-ia) ]/2 .

% 

% Similarly, 

%

%   sin(a) = [ exp(ia) - exp(-ia) ] / 2i.

%

% Our transform scans over w (or f), looking for nonzero values. Under the

% integral sign, we have

% 

% exp(i w t) [ exp(i 2 pi 10 t) + exp( -i 2 pi 10 t)] = 

%               exp(i (w- 2 pi 10) t)) + exp(i(w + 2 pi 10) t). 

%

% The integral of an imaginary exponential turns out to be zero unless what is 

% in the exponent exactly cancels, giving you exp(0) = 1. This happens for 

% the first term at w = 2 pi 10, and for the second term at w = - 2 pi 10.



% So, we expect two peaks for our transform, at f = 10 and at f = -10. 



% Why do the peaks show up in the output array at index 10 and 90? It turns

% out that the negative frequencies are arranged after the positive ones. 

% The ordering runs 0 through to max frequency W, then from -W to -min

% frequency. From now on, we'll use the matlab function "fftshift" to rearrange 

% them in the usual increasing order. 

%

% Let's have a look at the transform of a sine wave as well:

% (note here I'm switching to a plotting form more appropriate for this

% kind of spiky function, and I'm scaling the y axes of the real and imaginary

% parts by the same amount so we don't see all that 10^-13 stuff)

% Just as we should now expect: the large values are in the imaginary part,

% because of that i in the definition of sine, and include a positive and 

% a negative peak, because of the sign difference between the exponents.



% Did you expect that the +f component would come out with a negative sign? Why?



% This is a good moment to think what exactly the minimum and maximum 

% frequencies are. 

% The lowest frequency is determined by the length of the sample. If the

% sample is of length T, then the lowest frequency that can be resolved is

% 1/T.  How about the highest frequency?  If the sampling rate is dt, then

% you cannot specify any frequency higher than 1/2dt. That is because you

% need at least 2 points to capture an oscillation, one on the up part and

% one on the down part. This frequency is called the NYQUIST frequency.

% The Nyquist frequency says that you must sample at least twice as often as 

% the shortest wavelength in your data.  In class we'll try to look at what happens 

% if your signal contains frequencies higher than your sampling rate.

% Summary of the pairs. 

%

% (1) A gaussian in time is composed of frequencies that fall off from 0 in 

% the shape of a gaussian. This is cool! It's also a unique property of the 

% Gaussian!  Remember that a Fourier transform is just a linear operation. 

% The Gaussian has the special property that it has the same form (Gaussian) 

% under any linear transformation. But the width will be different. If the 

% Gaussian is narrow in time, it will be wide in frequency. And if it is narrow 

% in frequency, it will be broad in time. Guess what: this is related to the uncertainty

% principle! If something is localized in time, it is spread out in

% spectrum (or energy). And vice versa.

%

% (2) A pulse has FT that is periodic under an envelope that

% falls off with frequency. This turns out to be the sin(w)/w function,

% called sinc(w). This is very important as data that is windowed with

% a square envelope is going to show signs of this function. That phenomenon is

% called "ringing".



% (3) A sine function with frequency 1 has an FT with

% weight only at freq=1. We'll deal with phase in a moment. 



% (4) Here's the sine function with frequency 10.



% (5) An exponential looks a lot like an exponential; the weights fall

% off as 1/frequency.



% (6) A delta function is made by adding sinusoids of equal weight at every

% frequency. 



% (7) A comb function has FT that is also a comb function at the

% frequency of the samples and its harmonics.



%

% Pause and reflect. There are a few things to mention. 

%

% First, notice that the zero frequency is special. It represents the mean 

% level: the nonsinusoidal component: the cos(0) component. This component is 

% always purely real.



% Invertibility and Hermitian symmetry. The FT decomposes our signals into sums of

% sines and cosines. This process is invertible. We could start with the

% Fourier transform -- a list of "intensities" at each frequency -- and

% convert it to a list of "intensities" as a function of time. The reason

% we can get away with this is that when we listed our intensities in the

% "frequency domain," we were careful to give two values: amplitude and

% phase, or cosine and sine components, or real and imaginary parts.  To

% ensure that the process is really invertible, we also need to make sure

% that we have the right number of values in the transforms. Put simply, we

% had better represent enough frequencies in the FT so that we can

% reconstitute the original signal by adding together all the right

% sinusoids. Let's look at how many frequencies we need to represent the 

% time functions we've been dealing with. If you left dt=

% 0.01 alone, the answer is 100. 



length(t)

%%

% So all of the functions of time that we've considered are described by a

% list this long containing the weights at each time point. What about the

% FT? The highest frequency is the Nyquist, which

% is half the sampling rate. That gives us just 50 frequencies.  How do

% we transform 100 values into just 50 frequencies? You know the answer: at each

% frequency we need 2 numbers, a cosine and a sine component (or amplitude

% and phase). Moreover, for the 0 frequency, there is just one component

% becuase sin(0)=0. Since cos(0)=1, it's clear that the weight at freq=0 is

% just a constant function of time. Also, at the nyquist frequency itself,

% all we can have is a cosine component. To see why, recognize that we only

% have enough samples in time to represent alternating positive and

% negative values at adjacent time points. If you put a 0 at t=0, which you

% must for sin(t), then there's nothing to alternate. Okay, cool, we've got

% two components for each of the frequencies 1 to nyquist-1, one weight at

% freq=0 and one weight at freq=nyquist. That's 100 values in the FT, which

% corresponds to 100 values in the time function. Perfect!

%

% So what's the deal with the negative frequencies? The

% frequency axis does not go from 0 to nyquist but from -nyquist to

% nyquist-1. Doesn't that screw up our bookkeeping?  Here's the answer. We

% have only considered the Fourier transform of real valued functions of time

% (left column of Fig. 5). The Fourier transform returns complex numbers at

% each frequency, which we can think of a sine waves (imaginary part) and

% cosine waves (real part). In fact the Fourier transform can act

% on complex functions of time. Instead of a real value at each time, we

% could have a complex number. We may not have any use for this, but the

% full transform takes these 2-vectors (real and imaginary parts) and

% transforms them to 4 values: a real and imaginary value at two

% frequencies, one positive and one negative. Of course, there are half as

% many frequencies as there are time points. What I'm saying is that we

% actually had twice as many values in our time functions as we thought. We

% used real functions of time. The extra 100 values were zeros: the weights

% on the imaginary part of the signals.  So the transform is 1 to 1.

%

% That's all fine and good in theory, but what we care about for most

% applications is the Fourier transform of real valued functions. That's

% like saying that we know that the imaginary part of the functions in the

% left column of Fig. 5 is 0 at every time point. So, I'll ask again, why

% should the FT have 200 values to represent a signal that we can describe

% by 100 points in time? The answer is that the FTs of real signals really

% can be represented with just 100 numbers, just like we said. You really

% don't need both positive and negative frequencies. If I tell you the

% weights for one of them (e.g., +5 Hz component), you know the weights of

% the negative frequency (e.g., -5 Hz component). This shows up as a kind

% of symmetry in the graphs in Figure 5. See if you can deduce the rule from 

% these examples.

%

% I will pose this as a homework problem. First a reminder. An even symmetric

% function obeys the rule f(x) = f(-x). An example is cos(x). An odd symmetric

% function is one that obeys the rule f(x) = -f(-x). An example is sin(x).  

%

% QUESTION: Which of the seven functions in Fig. 5 are even? Which is odd?

% Which is neither even nor odd? What do you notice about the Fourier

% transforms of the even and odd symmetric functions. Answer this for the

% three categories: even, odd, neither even nor odd.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Part II. Convolution

%

% One of the most important uses of the FT is for computing convolution.

% Convolution is an operation that looks like filtering. It takes a signal

% and converts it to a new signal. Usually, we can think of the new signal

% as a filtered version of the old one. We gain a deep intuition for the

% process by conceptualizing the operation in the time domain and in the

% frequency domain (i.e., via the fourier transform). I think this is one

% of the most beautiful concepts in applied math -- and it comes up all the

% time (or often if you prefer a frequency based description!).

%

% **** II.1 Convolution in the time domain. ****

%

% In this section, we spend a lot of time understanding convolution without

% talking about FTs. But I want you to keep FTs in the back of your mind

% while we do this. What you should be asking yourself is this. When

% filtering looks like blurring, isn't that a lot like attenuating sharp

% aspects of a signal, and isn't that a lot like attenuating high

% frequencies?

%

% Let's get started.

% Consider the simplest of all possible signals: a delta function,

% otherwise known as a click (if it were sound pressure as a function of

% time) or a line (if it were light intensity as a function of horizontal

% position).

%%

timeOfImpulse = .1

s1 = zeros(size(t)); s1(t==timeOfImpulse)=1;

figure(1),clf,plot(t,s1)

%%

% Consider a blurring function. Let's start with one that you've grown

% accustomed to: eponential decay. We'll see in a moment that this function

% is causal, a useful property when it comes to time-dependent functions.

tau = .03;      % choose a time constant

b = exp(-t/tau);

plot(t,b)

set(gca,'XLim',[0 timeOfImpulse+10*tau])

xlabel('Time [out to 10\tau]')

%%

% Please run this next step without thinking about it. It's a trick that

% allows me to make some pictures easily. You can come back to this if you

% want to pursue the matrix version of convolution.

A = tril(toeplitz(b));

% figure(2), clf, imagesc(A)

% plot(A(:,end))

%%

% What is convolution?

%

% It is a blurring of s1 by b. It is a new function of time that can be

% thought of as a weighted sum of s1. It's actually easy to see what it is

% by looking at the formula.  

%

% s2(k) = Sum_over_d{product of s1(d) * b(k-d)}

%

% s2 is the result of the convolution. It is a function of time, but you've

% probably noticed that the variable t is not in the equation.  Actually

% both k and d refer to time, but because we are about to shift things

% around time takes on several meanings.   It's actually easier to keep

% things straight if we keep t out of the equation. The convolution is

% defined at each time, which I will denote by k. You will come to

% view k as an offset of the blur function.  The original signal remains a

% function of time, but we'll use a dummy variable for time. That's what d

% stands for: we can refer to d as "dime".  There is nothing special about

% s1(d). It is the signal plotted as a function of "dime" instead of time.

% Same thing -- no problem. What is b(k-d)?  It is b reflected about the

% y-axis and then offset by k time steps to the right.  Here is what b(k-d)

% looks like when k=0.

d = t;

figure(1), clf

plot(-d,b)

% Here is what b(k-d) looks like for increasing values of k.

% It is a picture of the function reflected around the ordinate and then

% offet to the right by k. Can you see this? 



% Now let's generate the convolution, s2(k), step of k by step of k.

% First look at the equation and convince yourself that there is one value of the

% convolution produced at each offset step. Run the animation in the next

% loop. You might want to put some pauses in the code. Here's what you

% should see. In the top panel, s1(d) is shown by a stem function in red. It is

% just an impulse. The blur function, b(k-d) is shown in blue. It is

% stepped along as k increases. The middle panel shows the product of s1(d)

% times b(k-d). Notice that there is a value at each value for dummy time.

% The bottom plot shows the sum of the products. At each time step, k, we

% get just one value. This is the convolution, s2(k). You will notice that

% the sum is weighted by the width of the time bins. Why is this? What

% effect does this have on the relationship between s1 and s2?

% **** II.2 Convolution and Fourier transforms ****

% 

% Fourier transforms make convolution easy. That's because convolution

% between two functions of time, like s1(t) and b(t), is equivalent to

% multiplying their fourier transforms. To be more precise, if S1(w) is the

% fourier transform of s1(t) and B(w) is the FT of b(t), then

%

% S2(w) = S1(w) .* B(w) 

%

% is the FT of s2(t).

%

% This provides a simple recipe for computing convolutions. (1) Take the

% fourier transforms of the two functions you want to convolve. (2)

% multiply the FTs (there's a complex number at each frequency!). (3) Take

% the inverse fourier transform. 

%

% Let's do this with the exponential blurring function and s1. To work with

% b, I need it to be defined on the same time axis as s1. I'll call it

% newb.

newb = zeros(size(t));

newb(1:length(b)) = b;


% Take the fourier transforms

B = fft(newb);

S1 = fft(s1);


% Multiply them at each frequency.

S2 = B .* S1;


% Take the inverse fourier transform

s2 = ifft(S2);

%%

% How does s2 look?

% You have already seen the fourier transforms of the signal and

% exponential. So I'm just going to plot the result

figure(4), clf

plot(t,s2)

%%

% Let's illustrate with a more realistic set of functions.

s1 = sin(2*pi*3*t) + .33 * sin(2*pi*9*t) + .2 * sin(2.*pi*15*t);

% Corrupt this signal by adding noise

s1 = s1 + rand(size(s1));

S1 = fft(s1);

% You could use a different blurring function. I'll apply a gaussian blur.

% See if you can figure out what the fftshift is doing here.

g = fftshift(exp(-((t-.5)/tau).^2));

G = fft(g);

S2 = G .* S1;

% Additional topics. You should work on all of these. If they paid me more to

% teach this class, I would continue the tutorial to cover these topics.

% But I'll leave them to you.

%

% 1. Develop better intutions about filters and multiplication in the freq domain.

% Find real world examples: muffling of a cheap speaker, resonance and timbre in

% musical instruments, blurring of an image by an imperfect lense. 

%

% 2. What is a bode plot? What is a power spectrum?

%

% 3. What is an impulse response function? Why is it useful? If I play a

% click through a speaker, it comes out a little less sharp. The shape of

% this output function is an example of an impulse response function. What

% is it good for? How does it relate to what your speaker will do when you

% send it signals that represent music? Answer this question in terms of

% convolution and fourier transforms. What are the critical assumptions in

% this argument (hint, there are 2 tenets to linear systems theory). 

% 

% 4. Filtering a signal is equivalent to attenuating frequencies. Given

% this idea, think about designing a filter by specifying its amplitude

% spectrum. What problems do you face? Why can't you make a filter that

% passes a band of frequencies from 10-20 Hz but cuts out all other

% frequencies? (Hint1: FT pairs are symmetrical if you know f(t) <---> F(w)

% are a transform pair, then F(t) <---> f(w) are also transform pairs. Hint

% 2: apply hint 1 to the pulse(t)<-->sinc(w) transform pair.)

% Why does the sampled waveform look so crumby? Look at the FT of ysampled.

% Notice the amplitude at low frequencies. What are they doing there? We

% did not make y using low frequencies? They are "aliases". Recall that

% convolution between two time-functions corresponds to multiplication

% between their FTs. What do you think multiplying two time functions

% corresponds to?  With the answer to that question in mind, what is the

% fourier transform of y, comb10 and what do you think you would do with

% these fourier transforms to produce the fourier transform of ysampled?

% Think hard about what is going on in these graphs.  Why do you think this

% undersampling of y produces "aliasing"? What is going on in the frequency

% domain when you multiply y by comb10?

Measurements in different daylight illuminations. The samples that were measured
are the reference white (BaSO4), spruce tree (distance from the measuring
equipment about 100 meters) and the sky reflected by the mirror.

Measuring equipment: PR 713/702 AM spectroradiometer

Wavelength interval: 390 nm - 1070 nm

Wavelength resolution: 4 nm

File formats: 	ASCII (daylight.asc.tgz) and MATLAB (daylight.mat.tgz).
		In the ASCII files each row is one spectrum and in the MATLAB
		files the spectra are stored in column order.

Measurers: Jussi Parkkinen and Pertti Silfsten (LTKK)

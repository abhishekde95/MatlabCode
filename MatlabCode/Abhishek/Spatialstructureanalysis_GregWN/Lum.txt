% Luminance cells
% Just selected by eye - looking at the STA at the "peak" frame.  It might be nice someday to have a
% more automated way of doing this.  Right now, I'm just trying to get something together for some
% pilot analyses:
% 1) Effects of fixational eye movements on response
% 2) Correlation between preferred spatial frequency and static non-linearity
% 3) Correlation between preferred spatial frequency and responses to chromatic gratings
% 4) Correlation between RF parameters measured with gratings and white noise 
% 		(orientation, SF, direction selectivity, bandwidth?, color?)
% Some of these are undoubtly complex cells.

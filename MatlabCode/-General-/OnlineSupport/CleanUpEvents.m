% Once we've crunched the data from a single trial
% we remove it from the p structure.  We don't just reinitialize
% the p structure though because it may contain some of the ecodes 
% from the next trial.
%
% If p.processnowcode is set to something non-zero, this function will
% remove all the events that preceded the earliest instantiation of that 
% code and set p.lastprocessed_t to the time of that code.  This is useful
% for online analyses that wait until a particular code shows up and then
% does some processing on (a trial's-worth) of data.
%
% Alternatively, if p.processnowcode is set to 0, we remove all the events
% that precede p.lastprocessed_t (which, in this circumstance, is expected 
% to be set by the user somewhere in the online analysis code itself).
% This is useful for online analyses that do not wait for a particular code
% to be dropped before processing data.
